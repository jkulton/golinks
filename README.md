## golinks

golinks in your browser, without the need to modify DNS settings or run a server.

This is an unpacked Chrome extension which leverages Chrome's [`declarativeNetRequest`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/declarativeNetRequest) to function as an all-in-one golinks system for personal use. For more information about how this works read _[Personal golinks in 2025](https://jkulton.com/2025/personal-golinks-in-2025/)_.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> All golink data is stored **locally** using Chrome's [`storage.local`](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage#storage_areas)
