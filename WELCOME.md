# Welcome to golinks!

You just installed the golinks extension!

Type `go/` into your Chrome address bar and press Enter to visit the extension's homepage. This page lists all your golinks. (You can also visit this page by pinning the extension, then click the icon and selecting **Options**)

Use a golink by typing `go/NAME` into your address bar and then pressing Enter to navigate.

One golink comes preinstalled: [go/help](http://go/help). It leads to this doc!

## Tips & Usage

- Add single golinks by clicking **Create** on the golinks homepage (or by attempting to navigate to a golink that doesn't yet exist!)
- Add multiple golinks via csv by using **Import** from the golinks homepage
- Instead of using long golinks like `go/github-repos`, use slashes to namespace like `go/gh/repos`
- If you need ideas for golinks, use the **Import** feature on the golinks homepage and start with this list:
